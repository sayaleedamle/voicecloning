I have tried to make a voice cloning function using TTS

This file will tell what I have tried to implement:
1. using pyttsx3 google voice recognizer to understand voice and convert it to text 
2. save this audio to a file
3. use this audio to convert to human speech using TTS.

   This is a different approach but needs some more time to work on, as it is not functioning. Here, pretrained models are of good use.
Install:
1.https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS
2. gtts
3. pyttsx3
4. SpeechRecognition
