Hi!!
I have tried to make a voice cloning program using pre trained model

As mentioned,
The amount of code must be small, so tried to integrate Google voice recognition from pyttsx3 and TTS.

I have tried integrate 2 different processes into one.
1. take audio from user of the text, recognize the text and save the audio.
2. apply voice cloning model from TTS on to it

the 2nd step doesn't work and due to time constraint I didnt get a chance to research more about it, but I learnt alot from it!
I think it tests only pretrained voices, which is not what I wanted.

Will continue to work on it to make it better!

Thanks,
Sayalee Damle
